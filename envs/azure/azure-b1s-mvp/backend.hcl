# Azure Backend Configuration for Local Development
# This file is used for local Terraform operations

# Note: For CI/CD, backend configuration is passed dynamically
# For local development, we'll use local state by default

# Uncomment and configure the following for remote backend:
# resource_group_name  = "cloud-app-starter-tfstate-rg"
# storage_account_name = "your-tfstate-storage-account"
# container_name       = "tfstate"
# key                  = "azure-b1s-mvp.tfstate"
